            on one or more of the following legal grounds:
          </p>
          <p>

            entering into any such contract;
          </p>
          <p>
            To comply with our legal obligations (for example, to keep pension
            records or records for tax purposes);
          </p>
          <p>
            Because processing is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate
            interest or those of any third party recipients that receive your
            Personal Information, provided that such interests are not
            overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.
          </p>
          <p>

            for the purpose of providing products or services and for

            behalf and in accordance with our instructions and based on our
            legitimate interest to provide, maintain and improve our products

            participant in the relevant system, to counterparties, dealers,
            custodians, intermediaries and others where disclosure is reasonably
            intended for the purpose of effecting, managing or reporting
            transactions in connection with the provision of our services or
            establishing a relationship with a view to such transactions;

            Otherwise, we will only disclose your Personal Information when you
            direct us or give us permission to do so, when we are allowed or
            required by applicable law or judicial or official request to do so,
            or as required to investigate actual or suspected fraudulent or
            criminal activities.

            For Personal Information subject to the General Data Protection
            Regulation (EU) 2016/679 ("GDPR") or the UK General Data Protection
            Regulation ("UK GDPR") we may transfer your Personal Information
            outside the EEA or the United Kingdom (the "UK") for the Permitted
            Purposes as described above. This may include countries that do not
            provide the same level of protection as the laws of your home
            country (for example, the laws within the EEA, the UK or the United
            States). We will ensure that any such international transfers are
            made subject to appropriate or suitable safeguards if required by
            the GDPR, UK GDPR or other relevant laws. You may contact us at any
            time using the contact details below if you would like further

          </p>
          <p>
            With respect to persons covered by GDPR, in case Personal
            Information is transferred to countries or territories outside of
            the EEA, or in the case of UK GDPR outside of the UK, that are not
            recognized by the European Commission as offering an adequate level
            of data protection, we have put in place appropriate data transfer
            mechanisms to ensure Personal Information is protected.

            to cancel any request that you have made of us, please let us know
            by contacting MCLP Client Service through the MCLP website at

            With respect to residents of the EEA, the UK and the People's

            you have a number of legal rights under GDPR, UK GDPR and/or PIPL in

            Obtaining information regarding the processing of your personal

            entitled to retain it;
          </p>
          <p>
            Objecting to, and requesting that we restrict, our processing of
            your personal information in certain circumstances. Again, there may
            be circumstances where you object to, or ask us to restrict, our
            processing of your personal information but we are legally entitled
            to refuse that request;
          </p>
          <p>
            Withdrawing your consent, although in certain circumstances it may
            be lawful for us to continue processing without your consent if we
            have another legitimate reason (other than consent) for doing so.

            copy of a valid means of identification in order for us to comply
            with our security obligations and to prevent unauthorized disclosure
            of data. We reserve the right to charge you a reasonable
            administrative fee for any manifestly unfounded or excessive
            requests concerning your access to your data and for any additional
            copies of the Personal Information you request from us.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will consider any requests or complaints that we receive and
            provide you with a response in a timely manner. If you are not
            satisfied with our response, you may take your complaint to the
            relevant privacy regulator. We will provide you with details of your
            relevant regulator upon request.

            Notice to California Residents: As a federally-regulated provider of
            financial services, MCLP is broadly exempt from the California
            Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"). Personal information we collect from
            clients and prospective clients is protected under separate federal
            legislation. Over the past 12 months, the only type of information
            we have collected potentially subject to the CCPA is web- browsing
            information regarding passive visitors to our website who are
            California residents, but are not our clients and do not provide us
            with any specific personal information (name, email address, street
            address, social security number, etc.) to request information about
            our services, start an account application or become a client.
            Information collected from these anonymous, passive visitors to our
            website may include IP address and browser-specific tags. We do not
            sell this information to third parties. We only use this information
            for internal purposes, such as to determine which advertisements are
            working and which content on our website is most interesting to
            visitors. Under the CCPA, California residents connected to this
            type of web-browsing data have a right to request access to it or
            request that it be deleted. However, we are unable (and not
            required) to process such requests because we cannot connect such
            passive web-browsing information collected with an email address or
            other personal information that we can use to verify that a
            requesting party is in fact connected to a specific web-browser or
            IP address.
          </p>
          <p>Updates to this Privacy Policy</p>
          <p>
            This Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated at the
            top of this Policy. We reserve the right to update and change this
            Privacy Policy from time to time, for example, in order to reflect
            any changes to the way in which we process your Personal Information
            or changing legal requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            In case of any such changes, we will post the changed Privacy Policy
            on our website or publish it otherwise. The changes will take effect
            as soon as they are posted on our website.

          <p>Magic Compass LTDs' conservative and prudent risk management helps keep your assets safe.</p>
          <p>We invest your cash in very short-term government securities maturing in a few months.</p>
          <p>As they mature, we continuously roll them forward into freshly issued securities.</p>
          <p>As their interest rate sensitivity is very low, the realized loss would be minimal if they ever needed to be sold.</p>
          <p>We are required to mark ALL investments to market and report their value to the regulators and investors, so that any issues are immediately recognized.</p>
          <p>Compare our risk management policies with other banks and brokers that are not required to immediately recognize losses on their investments and invest in longer-term assets to maximize their current profits. Our prudent risk management allows us to pay the highest rates on deposits and charge the lowest rates on margin loans because we are always invested in the current short-term benchmark rate.</p>
